# The Code remembers.
## Exponential Searching
Exponential search allows for searching through a sorted, unbounded list for a specified input value (the search "key"). 
The algorithm consists of two stages. 
The first stage determines a range in which the search key would reside if it were in the list. 
In the second stage, a binary search is performed on this range.

I'll try to improve or break the codes as much as possible :)
