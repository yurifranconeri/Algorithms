# A Coder always code his codesg
Repository to study, practice and **have fun** with algorithms and data structures using **C#**, with unit tests, always! 

## Algorithms

### Searching

- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Jump Search
- Interpolation Search
- Exponential Search

I'll try to improve or break the codes as much as possible :)

> The man who codes the program should create the tests!
